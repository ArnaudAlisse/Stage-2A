To determine the max capacity of power we can import from the offshore power plant or the minimal number of cable needed, we need another objective function.

Max power capacity that we can import :



Minimal number of cable (and which one) : Objective function = min ( sum ( sum ( C1_ij*Z_ij + C2_ij*Y_ij) for j >i) for i = 1:N) 
With N the number of bus, C1_ij the cost of a DC line, C2_ij the cost of a super conducting line, Z_ij and Y_ij = 0 or 1, depend of the state of the switch on the branch between the bus i and the bus j. 
If Z_ij (or Y_ij) = 0 at the end, we won't build this branch, if it's 1, we will build it.


Constraint : 

All the constrait of PowerFlow and optimal Power flow already in PowerModel
+
0<=Z_ij + Y_ij<=1

We must find a better way to write the sums (like taking j in the bus connected to i on which we've put a switch, hence, we can have some sets branch, and some optionnal branchs.)
